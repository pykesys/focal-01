Challenge

Challenge:
The goal is to make an existing application ready for production. Given code from our end (README + requirements):
* Dockerize
* Deploy the application to local kubernetes solution (minikube, k3d, â€¦) using helm chart
* Propose valuable metrics to the application and add them (for example via prometheus client)
* Write down how you would like to use those metrics in production (alerts, dashboards etc.)
